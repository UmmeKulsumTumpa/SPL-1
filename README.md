# Software Project Lab-1
# Code Metric Calculator
## Project Description:
I will build a software tool named Code Metric Calculator(CMC). This calculator
will measure some aspect of the quality or performance of a Java source code. It will
calculate some basic code metrics listed below:

**1.** Lines of code(LOC)
**2.** Cyclomatic Complexity(CC)
**3.** Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)
**4.** Number of methods in a class
**5.** Number of fields in a class
    
These metrics can be used for identifying areas of the code that may require
refactoring or optimization, measuring the complexity of the code, Improving code
quality, measuring progress and so on.
